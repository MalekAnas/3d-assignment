**What is responsive design?**

First, here’s a quick explanation of responsive design and how it works. 
Essentially, responsive design is a way to put together a website so that
it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size 
on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, 
and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.

The ultimate goal of responsive design is to avoid the unnecessary resizing, scrolling, 
zooming, or panning that occurs with sites that have not been optimized for different devices. 
It is often very difficult to navigate these sites, and it may even cost you potential customers 
who become frustrated with trying to figure out how to do something.

Responsive website design also replaces the previous need to design a dedicated mobile website for 
smartphone users. Now, instead of designing multiple websites for different screen sizes, you can 
design just one website that scales up or down automatically to match the device it’s being viewed on.

Why should you invest in responsive design?
We live in a multi-screen society. Because of this, it’s important for your site to be viewable across as 
many devices as possible, because you never know what device someone will be using to view your website.

Responsive website stats suggest that it’s wise to appeal to both desktop and mobile viewers. The number of 
mobile viewers now outnumbers desktop, and this number will only continue to rise as global smartphone accessibility 
increases.

Additionally, in early 2015, Google announced that mobile-friendliness would become a ranking factor in its search engine algorithms. 
This meant that sites that were mobile-friendly would potentially lose some ground in search engine results because they wouldn’t be 
delivering a good experience to mobile searchers and viewers.

In summary, the benefits of choosing responsive design for your website include:

Cost effectiveness
Flexibility
Improved user experience
Search engine optimization gains
Ease of management.
