What is responsive design?
----------------------------



First, here’s a quick explanation of responsive design and how it works. 
Essentially, responsive design is a way to put together a website so that
it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size 
on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, 
and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.

The ultimate goal of responsive design is to avoid the unnecessary resizing, scrolling, 
zooming, or panning that occurs with sites that have not been optimized for different devices. 
It is often very difficult to navigate these sites, and it may even cost you potential customers 
who become frustrated with trying to figure out how to do something.

Responsive website design also replaces the previous need to design a dedicated mobile website for 
smartphone users. Now, instead of designing multiple websites for different screen sizes, you can 
design just one website that scales up or down automatically to match the device it’s being viewed on.

Why should you invest in responsive design?
We live in a multi-screen society. Because of this, it’s important for your site to be viewable across as 
many devices as possible, because you never know what device someone will be using to view your website.

Responsive website stats suggest that it’s wise to appeal to both desktop and mobile viewers. The number of 
mobile viewers now outnumbers desktop, and this number will only continue to rise as global smartphone accessibility 
increases.

Additionally, in early 2015, Google announced that mobile-friendliness would become a ranking factor in its search engine algorithms. 
This meant that sites that were mobile-friendly would potentially lose some ground in search engine results because they wouldn’t be 
delivering a good experience to mobile searchers and viewers.

In summary, the benefits of choosing responsive design for your website include:

Cost effectiveness
Flexibility
Improved user experience
Search engine optimization gains
Ease of management.

What Is Offsite SEO?
----------------------


We’ll start our discussion with one major thing you can do offsite – link building. Link building is when links to your website are found elsewhere on the web. It is important to understand that while any link from a reputable source outside your site is good, you need to work at getting these naturally. The search engines also give more weight to certain kinds of links. For example, you can have your website listed on any number of index sites. You can also get a link when someone likes what you have written, and they mention your website on their site. The search engines will look at the two links and give greater points for the second because it was organic.


### Getting External Links

There are several ways in which you can build up external links. Here are the most valuable.

- ##### Creating a Press Release
  Every time you add something spectacular to your site, send out a news release. Each news site that chooses to post your press release will give you a link back     to your site.

- ##### Social Media Mentions
  When someone tweets something they found interesting on your site or posts a link on Facebook, search engines are happy. Pick two or three social media sites to  include in your regular marketing efforts.

- ##### Accepting Guest Posts
  When you allow someone else to post on your blog, they will naturally mention the post on their blog and social media, giving you highly-rated links.
